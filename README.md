# What it does
This game is a simple maze navigation game called "Marble Maze." The player controls a marble and navigates it through a maze. The goal is to move the marble around the maze without colliding with walls.
# How we built it
In this project, we built a simple maze game where a player navigates a marble using the arrow keys. Key techniques include grid-based collision detection, layered rendering for a 3D marble effect, and real-time input handling. 
# Accomplishments
1. Developed responsive marble movement with real-time collision detection, allowing the marble to avoid walls naturally.
2. Successfully created a basic, interactive maze game where players can control a marble to navigate through a grid-based maze.
3. This project provided hands-on experience with Pygame, teaching the developer essential skills in game programming, rendering, and event handling.
# What's Next?
This structure could be expanded with additional game features like levels, timers, or goals, enhancing the gameplay experience.
